## OSU Capstone Project Description

### Objectives

The goal for this project would be a graphical user interface that's capable of running on a Macbook Pro. The program will employ machine vision techniques and machine learning to be able to classify particle tracks found in CCD exposures in the form of numpy arrays or other image formats. The program will feature various ways of displaying particle tracks in the image by type, with options for labels, filtering by type, energy, vector, or any other attribute which can be ascertained in software. The project is somewhat open-ended, and the resulting product will depend on the creativity and resourcefulness of the student.

### Motivations

This project would enhance the capabilities of the existing system by extending its utility for real-time applications. The ability to visualize multiple particle types in real-time, and provide insight into the detection results would offer significant utility in a range of nuclear safety and security use cases.
